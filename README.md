# Russia-Losses-in-Ukraine

- I found this dataset on Kaggle, and it shows the Russian losses in equipment in Ukraine on a daily basis.
- I decided to download it to get some insights on the overall trend of Russian military losses over time, Are they increasing, decreasing, or fluctuating?
- I answered some questions related to the daily, weekly, monthly, and quarterly trend of losses, trying to predict the volume of the upcoming losses by analyzing the historical data for the total losses and each category of losses as well.
